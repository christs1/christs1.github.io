### CPSC 120
* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a good project to code because it was based around the
    game blackjack, a game that I personally enjoy from time to time. Seeing
    the game from the perspective of the programmer was very interesting
    because you can tell there are a lot of variables to be accounted for to
    make the game work. I would definitely like to go back and expand upon
    making a more in depth black jack game, like including an interface.


* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was also a fun project because of the goofiness of the project.
    of course it was a very simple program, but it also introduced working with
    arguments passed from the terminal, which I had not done in my previous C++
    class. I think that learning this is a good skill to have to test programs
    faster because sometimes it takes too much time to type in prompts by hand.


* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was a very informative project to code. It was like a bunch of
    tastes of different concepts like range based for loops, working with less than,
    greater than, minimums and maximums, etc. It was a nice change of pace with this
    program because it was not focused too heavily on one specific topic, but was
    like a refresher to solidify previous topics that we had discussed so far.
